<h1>BT Real Estate finder</h1>

<p>A site about finding real estates, made using Django</p>

<p>Functionalities include: register, login, logout, sending offers for estates with email feedback, limiting offers to one per user, complete admin area for staff only use, featuring estates through admin area.</p>

<p>This is the project used for learning how to use Django in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/python-django-dev-to-deployment/">Brad Traversy's Udemy course</a>.</p>

<p>Most of it is the same as proposed in the course, but I did a few touch ups, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Pagination in the 'search.html' page, using a trick to keep the information submitted from the form;
	</li>
	<li>
	Only 3 estates per page, so that pagination is more common;
	</li>
	<li>
		Conformance with PEP8, as much as possible.
	</li>
</ul>
